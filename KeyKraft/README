=KeyKraft=

Description:
-This program acts as a customizable unicode key generator with a purpose of creating bruteforce libraries.

Features:
-Custom tkinter-based GUI
-'Path' field holds a path to a folder where you are willing to place your key-vault
-'Length' controls the length of keys which you are willing to generate.
-'Symbols' switch corresponds to adding/removing ASCII 'printables' to your keys, 'digits' - [0-9],
    'letters' - lower and uppercase
-'Build path' Button creates a folder for your keys. If you did not assign a custom path it will create a folder
    in script's parent directory.
-'Learn Keys' feature is disabled before you activate 'Build Path' button
-'Kill path' button as opposed to 'Build path' kills the key folder (empty or not it cascade-deletes it entirely)

!!!ATTENTION!!!

If the length value is above 3-4 the key creation process may take up to an hour or more as it will write every
possible combination.

Testing on 1-2 symb.-long keys is recommended!
